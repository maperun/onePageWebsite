		<section class="history">
			<h3>A Brief History</h3>		
			<p>Legend has it that India Pale Ale (IPA) was first invented by the British in the late 1700's...by accident. As demand for beer grew, it became increasingly difficult to transport ales over long distances without it spoiling, and in regions like India, it was too hot to brew beer. To solve this problem, a London brewer named Hodgson decided to brew a beer with a higher alcohol content and more hops, which would act as preservatives. The beer not only survived the journey to India, but was found to have improved considerably. Lo and behold, the IPA was born.</p>
			<p>Over time, as palates became more refined and brewers looked for something new, a natural progression happened. Brewers started demonstrating their skill with bigger and bigger beers, fortified with massive doses of hops. IPA has evolved to become the world's most popular style of craft beer, and the top-selling craft beer in America.</p>

			<h3>Styles & Characteristics</h3>		
			<p>IPA is characterized by an abundance of hops which gives the beer it's bitterness, pleasant aroma, and complex flavor profile. Toffee, citrus, tropical, and floral notes are common. Appearance can range from a pale, golden color to a deep amber, though black IPA's also exist. Here are the 6 most common styles of IPA:</p>	<br>
			<p><span>English IPA: </span>A well balanced IPA; strong, malty character with roasted toffee flavors. <em>5-7% ABV</em></p>

			<p><span>Double(Imperial) IPA: </span>A stronger, more robust IPA; complex character; higher alcohol content. <em>8-10% ABV.</em></p> 
			<p><span>Session IPA: </span>A lighter IPA with big flavor; lower alcohol content; allows drinkers to enjoy several without getting too full. <em>3-5% ABV</em></p>
